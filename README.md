# Disaster Tweets Classification

This project involves a Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline to classify tweets as **disaster-related** or **not**. It is based on a dataset provided in a Kaggle competition: [Real or Not? NLP with Disaster Tweets](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started/).

## 📁 Files

- `Disaster Tweets Classification.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing data exploration, preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.

## 📌 Objective

To build a machine learning model that predicts whether a tweet is about a real disaster or not. The pipeline involves:
- Text preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Model training and validation
- Evaluation using accuracy/F1-score

## 🚀 Getting Started
